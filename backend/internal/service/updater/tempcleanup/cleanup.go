// os.TempDir() named mam-update-* and last modified before
// startedAt (the current process start time) are removed, so a download
// made by this process is never touched.

// Each failure (e.g. Windows refusing to delete the installer that is
// still running) is skipped; the others are still removed and
// the joined error is returned. The caller only logs it: a cleanup failure
// must not block startup. It returns how many directories were removed.
